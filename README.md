# Game-AI-Project
Welcome to the Game AI Project! This is a school project that includes implementations for a board game with AI players using various data structures and algorithms. The AI makes decisions based on a game tree and minimax algorithm.

**Project Structure**
**Files**
- game.py: Manages the game logic, player interactions, and game flow.
- a1partc.py: Contains implementations for stack, queue, and deque data structures.
- a1partd.py: Implements grid overflow simulation using a queue.
- a2parta.py: Implements a hash table with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and 
  searching.
- a2partb.py: Implements a game tree with minimax algorithm for decision-making in the board game.
- player1.py: Contains the AI for Player One, using the game tree to determine the best move.
- player2.py: Contains the AI for Player Two, similar to Player One but for the opposing side.

**Features**
  
- Data Structures: Custom implementations of stack, queue, and deque, and a hash table.
- Game Mechanics: Board game with rules and overflow simulation.
- AI Implementation: AI players using game trees and minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.

**Setup and Installation**

**Install dependencies:** This project does not have any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

**Run the game:**

Run game.py to start the game. This will set up the board and initialize the players.
The game logic and player interactions will be handled as defined in game.py.

**How It Works**
**Data Structures:**

a1partc.py: Implements basic stack, queue, and deque operations with dynamic resizing.
a1partd.py: Simulates grid overflow and manages state changes using a queue.

**Hash Table:**

a2parta.py: Implements a hash table with linear probing and dynamic resizing based on load factor.

**Game Tree and AI:**

- a2partb.py: Constructs a game tree and uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate and select the 
 best move.
- player1.py and player2.py: Define AI players for the game, using the game tree to make 
 decisions.
